## Python Script Files

The project includes the following Python scripts:

- `agent.py`: Defines the agent that interacts with the maze environment.
- `main.py`: Main script to run and coordinate the training or testing of the agent.
- `maze_env.py`: Implements the maze environment where the agent learns and operates.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `main.py` to start training or testing the agent in the maze environment.

## Notes

This project is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating maze solving using reinforcement learning techniques. Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed.
