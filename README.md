# Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository containing various projects on reinforcement learning.

## Projects

### Maze Project
- **Description:** This project explores reinforcement learning algorithms applied to solving maze navigation tasks. It involves implementing algorithms such as Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to find optimal paths through maze environments.
- **Technologies:** Python, OpenAI Gym (for maze environments), Reinforcement Learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

### Cartpole
- **Description:** The Cartpole project focuses on the classic control problem where an inverted pendulum (pole) must be balanced on top of a moving cart. Reinforcement learning techniques are used to train an agent to keep the pole balanced by controlling the cart's movements.
- **Technologies:** Python, OpenAI Gym (for Cartpole environment), Reinforcement Learning algorithms (e.g., Policy Gradient methods, DQN).
